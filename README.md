# LaterLink
 See a cool link but don't have time to read it now?  
 
 LaterLink is a single-page, local-only storage service that bounces web-links you'd like to save into your own Google Sheet as the back-end.  Save interesting weblinks for later and effortlessly browse them from your very own Google Sheet.  Here's how it works.

 ## Setup on the Google end

1. Start a new Google form and create 3 "short answer" questions. Call them "link," "keyword," and "notes" as shown here.

`link`, `keyword`, and `notes` as shown here. You must fill in the 3 answers with these words exactly.
